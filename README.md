Welcome to Jeopardy! project one at General Assembly by Katia Eidson.

In this Jeopardy game, the user should be able to click on a button to select the clue they want to answer. For each correct answer, the user earns the number of points chosen. For each incorrect answer, the user gets the amount of point deducted. The user wins when they reach 2000 points. The game ends after five rounds.
